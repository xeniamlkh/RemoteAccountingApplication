## Detailed Description
The Remote Accounting Application is ideal for tracking sales in remote locations such as tourist bases, small stalls, or kiosks. It allows to write down sales, export them as a user-friendly CSV file, and transport the file over a network with any messenger or email for further processing in the office. It is very convenient for places with poor network connections because it does not require a network connection for any operations except CSV file sharing. Moreover, a copy of the report is saved locally on the device, and it is possible to transfer it later at any time when required.

* The first page of the app shows a filling form for a sale registration. All fields except comments are mandatory. Name, product, sale type, and payment type fields will remember written text and will propose it.

* Handbooks store operational data such as product titles, names of the app users, sale types, and payment types. All the data is saved in a single copy without duplicates and is used in other parts of the app for automatic autocomplete and to count the quantity of goods. All handbooks are filled automatically.

* The app uses the Room DB, which is closely related to the app and is deleted when the app is uninstalled. So it may be critical to be able to save data if the app is uninstalled. To provide this functionality, the backup function is implemented. The backup is performed automatically with every fresh start of the app, and additionally, it is possible to create a backup manually through settings.
